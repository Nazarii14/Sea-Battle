# Sea Battle (version with interface)
#### This is a sea battle game for two players playing on the same device, in a browser.
#### When the game starts, both of the players choose their ships layout using 'regenerate' button and then save their changes using 'confirm' button.
#### Then all of this four buttons are disabled and the game starts.
#### Players start shooting at each other's boards while one of the players will make all the ships of his enemy sank.
#### Use message above the boards to track the game process, also i added an arrow pointing to the board where has to be the next shoot.
### For this project I used Flask, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
## At the moment this project is not deployed.
