# Sea Battle (version with interface)
#### This is a sea battle game for two players playing on the same device
#### When the game starts, both of the players choose their ships layout using 'regenerate' button and then save their changes using 'confirm' button.
#### Then players start shooting at each other's boards while one of players will make all the ships of enemy player sank.
### For this project I used Flask, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
## At the moment this project is not deployed.
